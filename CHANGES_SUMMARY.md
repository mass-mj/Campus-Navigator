# Google Maps Integration - Changes Summary

## Overview
We've updated the college finder application to replace the Leaflet maps with direct Google Maps links. This change simplifies the map implementation while still providing easy access to college locations.

## Database Changes
- Added a new `google_maps_url` column to the `colleges` table
- Populated the column with default Google Maps links for existing colleges

## File Changes

### Schema
- Created `schema/add_google_maps_url.sql` for database schema updates

### Admin Panel
- Updated `users/college-management.php`:
  - Added a new field for Google Maps URL in the college add/edit form
  - Modified the SQL queries to include the new field
  - Added helper text with example URLs
  - Added styling for the new form field

### College Details Page
- Updated `navpages/college-details.php`:
  - Removed all Leaflet maps code and dependencies
  - Replaced the map with a visually appealing Google Maps button
  - Added a pulsing animation effect to draw attention to the map button
  - Added location information display
  - Updated styling to improve user experience
  - Provided fallback for colleges without a specific Google Maps URL

## How to Use

### For Administrators
1. Run the SQL script to add the Google Maps URL column (see README_SQL_CHANGES.md)
2. When adding or editing colleges, you can now specify a custom Google Maps URL
3. If left blank, a default URL will be generated based on the college name and location

### For Users
1. Visit the college details page
2. Click the "View on Google Maps" button to open Google Maps in a new tab
3. The map will show the college location and allow for directions, street view, etc.

## Benefits
- Simpler implementation with fewer dependencies
- Leverages Google Maps' powerful features (directions, street view, etc.)
- Reduces load time and improves performance
- Administrators can customize the exact map location for each college
